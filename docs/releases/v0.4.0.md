## New Features

### Multi-Agent Team

Release Agent Team now includes 6 specialized agents that work together:

| Agent | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| `release-coordinator` | Orchestrates release workflow | opus |
| `pm` | Product scope and versioning | sonnet |
| `qa` | Build, test, lint validation | sonnet |
| `documentation` | Docs completeness checks | haiku |
| `release` | Git state and CI validation | sonnet |
| `security` | Vulnerability and compliance | sonnet |

### Workflow DAG

The agents follow a directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflow:

```
pm-validation
    ├──> qa-validation ──────────────┐
    ├──> docs-validation ────────────┤
    ├──> security-validation ────────┼──> execute-release
    └──> release-validation ─────────┘
         (depends on pm + qa)
```

### Multi-Platform Deployment

The same agent team can be deployed to multiple platforms:

- **Claude Code** - Markdown-based plugin with commands, skills, and agents
- **Kiro CLI** - JSON-based agent configurations with steering files
- **Gemini CLI** - TOML-based extension
- **AgentKit** - Local development server
- **AWS Bedrock** - AgentCore deployment
